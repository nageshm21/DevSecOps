DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) and its tools

DAST Summary
•	Definition: DAST stands for Dynamic Application Security Testing. It's used to test an application's security by actively interacting with it and trying to exploit vulnerabilities.

•	When It’s Performed:  DAST is conducted after deployment, aiming to detect vulnerabilities that weren't found during development. 

•	How It Works: It sends various inputs to the application and analyzes the responses for signs of vulnerabilities like: 
    o	Unhandled exceptions
    o   Error messages
    o   Unusual behavior

•	Purpose & Limitations:
    o	Helps identify and fix vulnerabilities.
    o	Not a replacement for other testing types like SAST (Static Analysis) or penetration testing.
    o	Best used in combination with other methods.

•	Popular Tools:
    o	Commercial: WebInspect, Veracode DAST, Burp Professional
    o	Free/Open Source: OWASP ZAP, Burp Community Edition
