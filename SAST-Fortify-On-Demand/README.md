SAST AND ITS TOOLS
 * SAST or Static Application Security Testing is a type of security testing that involves analyzing the source code of a software application to identify security vulnerabilities. SAST is typically performed during the development phase of an application, before it is deployed.
 * SAST tools are designed to analyze source code for known vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. They can also identify areas of the code that may be prone to security issues, such as code that is difficult to maintain or understand.
 * SAST tools typically operate by scanning the source code of an application and looking for patterns or specific vulnerabilities. The results of a SAST scan can be used to identify and fix vulnerabilities before an application is deployed, which can help to improve the overall security of the application.
